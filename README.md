# To-do list

Second React project I created without following any tutorial, The app allows the user to enter to-dos and their importance, check the completed ones, and rank all the to-dos based in input time, importance or checked (completed).

I practiced states more and more, especially filtering a list of items without any changes on the orignal list, applying immutability concept.
